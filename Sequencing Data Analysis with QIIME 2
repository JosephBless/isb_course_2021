FAQ
How do the presentation slides work?
The presentation itself is a webpage hosted on GitHub. Basically, it renders dynamically from a markdown file that includes the course. Editing the markdown file is sufficient to change the content of the presentation.

See the reveal docs for more info.

Preview locally
Open a terminal in the docs folder in the repo and use:

python -m http.server
This will preview the talks at localhost:8000/16S and localhost:8000/models in a browser. Editing the markdown and reloading the page should be enough.

PDF output
To generate a PDF of the course, open up the website in chromium or chrome and append ?print-pdf to the address. For instance, if you ran it locally as described above, open localhost:8000/16S?print-pdf in the browser. Then, choose 'print to PDF' (choose margins: none).
